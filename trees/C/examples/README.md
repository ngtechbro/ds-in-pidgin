# Trees Example.

Inside this folder, you go see real world examples or use cases of trees.
I go try make example use cases for all the types of tree we i do implementation for.

## Example 1: Phone book(file persistent) Binary Tree
- This example demonstrate how we fit use trees build phone book or contact management system. We go dey work with files so contacts wey we save go dey persistent.
  The system go make insert, modify, delete and search operations. I go also add auto complete feature for the edit and delete operation.

   ```bash
   make
   ./example1
   ```

### **Summary**
- This `examples/` folder go show practical use cases for trees.
- Example 1 go demonstrates how to use trees make persistent phone book management system.
- Each example dey well-commented and easy to run.

This structure go help una understand how to apply trees inside real-world matters. ðŸš€
